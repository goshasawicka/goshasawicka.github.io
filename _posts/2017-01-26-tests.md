The idea for writing this piece came to me after reading one of the Dan Abramov's tweet
about tests in React, or more strictly speaking, one of the comments under that tweet.

How surprised I was to see somebody daring to speak that they do not test their code. It was so obvious that EVERYONE has to write tests to make sure program does what it should. And there it is. People admiting to such a 'naugtiness'.

Of course very few of us like to write tests. It's tedious. It's sometimes boring. It's very often spliting hair. But we need that.

So here are some arguments for writing (good) tests. Because we shouldn't be bothered with writing them if their quality is going to be poorer than our actual code.

1. We are developers and not miners, factory employees or apple pickers. Our work cannot be measured by length of written "productive code". Actually the shorter we write the better, but thats a form of art for another post. So ... we need to stop thinking that writing tests is less productive than hacking another feature of the product we are creating.
2. Tests helps with changes in the future. Our programs are not static and will evolve with time. And if not? Well, it only means that the program is dead, so we would not care anyway. So if new features or optimizations are introduced, it means all testing has to be done again. Well written tests will help us deal with changes by confirming that one change in application will not cause a mess anywhere else.
3. Taking a step back helps you to discover edge cases not considered in the beginning of the project. Also will help us find hidden bugs.
4. Another positive of taking a step back is improving your code. Tests will often help you optimize your code when you see it from different perspective.
5. It's fun. Yeah, I don't believe it either, but you must admit that the view of green checkboxes is somehow gratifying. And solving "the mystery of unpassing test" can be treated as an exciting quest with Indiana Jones in search of holy grail ... or at least a puzzle. At least this is what I tell to myself until I believe it ... for a day.

These are only few of arguments for writing tests which I treat as a reminders for myself. Because there are days when you soaked to the bone coming to the office, coffee is not working, everyones are mad and stressed out and when being pressured by tight delivery schedules the last thing you want to do is to write tests for your code that already works. But remember: Testing code matters.
