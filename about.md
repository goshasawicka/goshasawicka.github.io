Web developer, Fullstack passionate, Mobile programmer ... Human golden retriever.

I'm an enthusiastic and positive thinking woman who (can) code. Excessive energy I utilize on web/mobile app development and running marathons. 

I have been been "on the other side" and worked as a Project Manager. This experience gave me a perspective on the work on both, technical and non-technical side. But if I have a choice, I will always choose the technical one.
